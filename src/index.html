            Meditation is a practice that involves training your attention and
            awareness to achieve a calm and clear state of mind. Through regular
            meditation, you can reduce stress, improve focus and concentration,
            enhance emotional well-being, and promote overall mental and
            physical health.

            Intense workouts can have a variety of benefits, including improving
            cardiovascular health, increasing muscle strength and endurance, and
            boosting metabolism for increased calorie burn. They can also
            provide a sense of accomplishment and improve overall mood and
            energy levels. It's important to note that intense workouts are not
            suitable for everyone, particularly those with certain health
            conditions or who are new to exercise.

            Splits is a stretching exercise that involves extending the legs in
            opposite directions until the hips are fully open and the legs are
            parallel to the floor. There are two main types of splits: the front
            split, where one leg is extended forward and the other leg is
            extended backward, and the side split, where both legs are extended
            to the sides.

            Ballet is a highly technical dance form that originated in the royal
            courts of Italy during the Renaissance and later developed into a
            highly structured and rigorous form in France and Russia. Ballet
            requires a great deal of discipline, focus, and physical strength
            and flexibility, and it typically involves precise and fluid
            movements of the body, often accompanied by music.

            traditional yoga, including postures (asanas), breathing exercises
            (pranayama), and meditation. It requires a deep understanding and
            experience of the principles and techniques of yoga, as well as a
            strong commitment to ongoing practice and study.
